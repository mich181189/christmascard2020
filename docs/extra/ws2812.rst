WS2812 Module
==============
.. py:module::ws2812

.. py:function:: init(count)
	Sets up the WS2812 module to handle *count* LEDs

.. py:function:: set_led(led, red, green, blue)

	Sets the colour of the led, identified by index *led* to the colour specified by *red*, *green* and *blue* which are integers from 0 to 255.

	.. note::
 		These LEDs are very bright! Values between 0 and 25 are probably easily bright enough! Setting too many LEDs to a high value can cause fairly high current draw, and the PCB can get very hot.
