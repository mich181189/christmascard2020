lm75 Module
===========
.. py:module::lm75

Handler for LM75 i2c temperature sensor. The LM75 temperature sensor is connected to the I2C bus, and continuously measures temperature, unless it is explicitly shutdown (see :py:meth:`lm75.LM75.shutdown`)

.. py:module:: lm75
.. py:class:: LM75(i2c [, address=72])

	Constructs an LM75 object. Takes an I2C object and optionally, an address of the LM75


	.. py:method:: get_temperature()

	Gets the current temperature, as measured by the LM75 module, in `degrees celsius <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius>`_

	Reading while the device is shutdown will result in the last temperature reading captured before the sensor was shutdown.

	.. py:method:: shutdown()

	Shuts down the LM75 temperature sensor, reducing current consumption. Also might be useful to prevent the temperature sensor from heating itself up too much, affecting measurements.

	To reverse this, call :py:meth:`wakeup`

	.. py:method:: wakeup()

	Wakes up the LM75, after a call to :py:meth:`shutdown`

	.. py:method:: is_shutdown()

	Returns True if the LM75 sensor is in a shutdown state
