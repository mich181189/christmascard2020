Christmas Card Hardware / Design Notes
======================================

.. rubric:: The hardware consists of:

* STM32F401RET6 Microcontroller
* 28 WS2812B LEDs (`Datasheet <../_static/WS2812B.pdf>`_)
* LM75B i2c Temperature Sensor
* A USB Connector

The microcontroller was chosen as the cheapest one available on `JLCPCB's SMT assembly service <https://jlcpcb.com/smt-assembly>`_ with decent Micropython support. This entire project was desgned in a bit of a rush ðŸ˜… 

The USB connector is a full-sized B connector. This is because it was relatively easy to solder on once I received the PCBs from JLC - I didn't fancy separately reflowing a connector on - if I had more time, I'd have chosen micro-B or maybe even USB-C

The name label was done with a Brother P-Touch label maker. I had originally intended to Sharpie on names, but it started to smudge a bit. I realised I had some 6mm tape for my label maker that worked nicely.

.. rubric:: Some Links

* The Schematic `is available as a PDF <../_static/schematic_1_0.pdf>`_ 
* The hardware design is `available on GitHub <https://github.com/mich181189/christmascard2020>`_
    * If you want to play with  the hardware design, it was designed in `KiCad <https://kicad.org/>`_
* The board runs `Micropython <http://micropython.org/>`_
* In case you need the firmware for some reason:
    * `firmware0.bin <../_static/firmware0.bin>`_ (0x08000000)
    * `firmware1.bin <../_static/firmware1.bin>`_ (0x08020000)
