========================

.. rubric:: The hardware consists of:

* STM32F401RET6 Microcontroller
* 28 WS2812B LEDs
* LM75B i2c Temperature Sensor
* A USB Connector

The microcontroller was chosen as the cheapest one available on `JLCPCB's SMT assembly service <https://jlcpcb.com/smt-assembly>`_ with decent Micropython support. This entire project was desgned in a bit of a rush ðŸ˜…
