Welcome to the Christmas Card 2020 docs!
===============================================

If you are reading this, you have probably received a christmas card from me. Or, maybe, you stumbled upon this project and are curious about  what I created.
This card is, in fact, a `Micropython <http://micropython.org/>`_ development board! It can, of course, be 
used as a simple decoration, but it is also programmable to your liking!
