# christmascard2020
I made a christmas card with WS2812B LEDs and it supports Micropython!

There is some HTML documentation generated from the /docs/ folder at https://mich181189.github.io/christmascard2020/index.html

The board is intended to run Micropython, a fork of which (with some additions to support this hardware) is available here: https://github.com/mich181189/christmascard2020_micropython
